# parsley

![Build](https://github.com/g-s-k/parsley/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
[![Crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/parsley)](https://crates.io/crates/parsley)

what if scheme...but rust. still working on a backronym.

`cargo install parsley` installs the interpreter - see the
[docs](https://docs.rs/parsley) if you want to use it as a library.

## high-level goals

1. a lightweight Scheme implementation...
2. that compiles to WebAssembly...
3. usable inside of a larger application without making too many sacrifices...
4. that is modular and extensible...
5. but includes enough definitions to be useful out of the box.

## on the horizon

- improve test coverage
  - More tests from SICP
  - Better coverage of the standard library
  - Example crates
- (eventually) R7RS compliance

## Navigating this repo

- The source for the main library is in `src`.
- The source for the `cargo install`-able binary is in `src/bin/parsley`.
- The source for the (`gh-pages`) homepage is in `examples/www`.
